# Notas:
# - Realizamos tres aproximaciones: - log(m)
#                                   - logit(q)
#                                   - log(q)
# - Para los modelos ARIMA se eligió el que diera mejores residuales.
# - El vector kappa fué multiplicado por -1 ya que mejoraba laes estimaciones.

# - Al final del documento se encuentran las tres tablas
